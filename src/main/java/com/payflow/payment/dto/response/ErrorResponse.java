/**
 * The single error shape returned by every failing endpoint.
 *
 * <p>Produced from two places, which between them cover the whole request path: {@code
 * GlobalExceptionHandler} for anything a controller or service throws, and {@code
 * JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint} / {@code RestAccessDeniedHandler} for failures raised inside
 * the security filter chain, before a controller is ever selected.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately matches auth-service's and wallet-service's {@code ErrorResponse} field for
 * field: a PayFlow client talks to several services and should not need per-service error
 * handling.
 *
 * <p>{@code validationErrors} is null, and so omitted from the JSON, for everything except a
 * request body that failed bean validation.
 *
 * @param timestamp        when the failure was handled
 * @param status           HTTP status code
 * @param error             HTTP reason phrase, e.g. {@code Conflict}
 * @param message           human-readable summary, safe to show a caller
 * @param path              request URI that failed
 * @param validationErrors  field name to rejection reason, only for 400s
