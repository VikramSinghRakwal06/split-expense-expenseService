/**
 * Externalised JWT settings, bound from the {@code payflow.jwt.*} configuration prefix.
 *
 * <p>Carries no token lifetimes: like wallet-service, this service only ever <em>verifies</em>
 * tokens minted by auth-service, and has no signing endpoint of its own.
 *
 * <p>Both values must match auth-service and wallet-service exactly. The secret is obvious —
 * HMAC verification fails otherwise — but the issuer matters just as much: it is checked on
 * every parse, so a token correctly signed by a <em>different</em> PayFlow environment that
 * happens to share a key is still rejected.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here has a compiled-in default. The dev fallbacks live in {@code
 * application.yml} as {@code ${JWT_SECRET:...}} placeholders; {@code application-prod.yml}
 * removes them, so a production start-up without a real secret fails fast rather than
 * trusting a value from source control.
 *
 * @param secret HMAC-SHA signing key, at least 32 bytes for HS256
 * @param issuer value required in the {@code iss} claim
